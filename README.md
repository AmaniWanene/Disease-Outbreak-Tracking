***Disease Detection System***

*Business Overview*

This AI-driven detection system leverages social media data to track outbreaks of influenza and tuberculosis, two significant public health threats with widespread respiratory impacts. By analyzing real-time posts for early signs of disease clusters, the system enables WHO and health agencies to identify potential outbreaks quickly. This proactive approach aims to reduce disease spread, improve response times, and ultimately lower morbidity and mortality rates.

*Problem Statement*

Early detection of influenza and tuberculosis outbreaks is critical, but official reporting often lags behind the initial spread. Social media data could provide an early warning system, but requires AI-powered analysis to identify and track disease trends before they become full-blown epidemics.

*Objectives*

Our main objective is early detection of potential influenza and tuberculosis outbreaks using real time twitter data. Our other objectives include;

1. Track the spread patterns of these diseases by monitoring symptom-related 
   keywords and geospatial data from social posts.  
2. Identify high-risk areas for outbreaks before they are officially reported.  
3. Develop predictive models to forecast the trajectory of potential outbreaks.  
4. Provide early alerts to public health organizations and government agencies to 
   enable faster response and intervention.

 *Proposed Solutions*
   
 1. Collect real-time social media data from Twitter using Twibot: and keyword- 
    based filtering.
2. Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect mentions of 
   disease symptoms, concerns, and outbreak-related keywords.
3. Conduct sentiment analysis to identify posts indicating fear, panic or growing 
   anxiety around potential outbreaks.
4. Leverage machine learning models like SVMs and neural networks to classify 
   social posts as related to disease outbreaks or not.
5. Utilize anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual spikes in outbreak- 
   related keywords and phrases.
6. Map the geospatial and temporal data to visualize disease spread patterns and 
   high-risk clusters.
7. Validate social media-derived insights against official health reports to 
   ensure accuracy.
8. Develop predictive models to forecast outbreak trajectories and build an 
   automated alert system for public health authorities.
